### Introduction
Hi!

I am Thien, a Vietnamese student currently studying at Nguyen Tri Phuong Secondary School and have a huge love for open-source software, especially for Linux Distributions. Currently, I am going to work as an intern at 3S Hue Intersoft. I have got 3-year using various Linux Distributions. I wish to get an extra job in Java development.

I like reading books, especially self-taught books like "The Power of Subconcious Mind", written by Joseph Murphy. Besides, I often go jogging every weekend because sitting in a long time coding is not good for my health.
